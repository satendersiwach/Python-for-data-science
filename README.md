Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for every person in the world is impractical. While we canâ€™t obtain a height measurement from everyone in the population, we can still sample some people. No question is how can we do it?

The Central Limit Theorem addresses this question exactly. Formally, it states that if we sample from a population using a sufficiently large sample size, the mean of the samples will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling) and most importantly this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original population.
